		<p class="bannerDescription">The Trees of DeKalb began 30 years ago when Michael Kirk began keeping notes about some of the most notable trees of DeKalb.  That project - then known as the Sentinel Trees of DeKalb - merged into this one when Michael, Sue, and Tom began working through the notes.  Our goal is to engage people with the wonderful variety of trees in their own neighborhoods, to collectively build a history of the trees of DeKalb, and to provide a repository where everyone who is interested in the project can contribute.  Underlying what you see here are two main databases: the DeKalb Parkway Tree Database and the Notable Trees of DeKalb Database, both hosted (for now) as Google Fusion Tables.  While we welcome <a href="mailto:tpingel@niu.edu">emailed</a> corrections or additions, we're always looking for more active participants who want to actively help with cataloging local trees.  Email Tom Pingel (<a href="mailto:tpingel@niu.edu">tpingel@niu.edu</a>) for more information about how you can get involved!
